# Crop-Recommendation-System
A Crop Recommendation System  (CRS) is an intelligent decision-support tool designed to help farmers choose the most suitable crop  for cultivation based on environmental and soil conditions.
A Crop Recommendation System (CRS) is an AI-based decision-support system that helps farmers 
determine the most suitable crops for cultivation based on various factors such as soil quality, weather 
conditions, and historical agricultural data. The system utilizes advanced technologies like Machine 
Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to analyze 
environmental conditions and provide accurate recommendations. 
With increasing challenges in agriculture, such as climate change, soil degradation, and inefficient 
resource use, farmers often struggle to maximize productivity and profitability. A CRS addresses these 
challenges by offering personalized crop suggestions, ensuring optimal resource utilization, and 
reducing risks associated with crop failures.
